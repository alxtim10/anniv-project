            In just one year, we’ve created a bond that feels unbreakable, and I’m so excited for everything that lies ahead. 
            Every day with you is a new chapter of joy, growth, and adventure, 
            and I can already feel that our story is only getting started. 
            I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us because I know as long as we’re together, 
            it will be nothing short of amazing. 
            Here’s to the many years of love, laughter, and dreams we still have to share.
